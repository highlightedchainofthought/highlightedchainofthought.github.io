                        An Achilles heel of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their tendency to hallucinate non-factual statements. A response mixed of factual and non-factual statements poses a challenge for humans to verify and accurately base their decisions on. To combat this problem, we propose Highlighted Chain-of-Thought Prompting (HoT), <b>a technique for prompting LLMs to generate responses with XML tags that ground facts to those provided in the query</b>. That is, given an input question, LLMs would first re-format the question to add XML tags highlighting key facts, and then, generate a response with highlights over the facts referenced from the input. Interestingly, in few-shot settings, <b>HoT outperforms vanilla chain of thought prompting</b> (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022)on a wide range of 17 tasks from arithmetic, reading comprehension to logical reasoning. We also test how much highlights help users detect when LLMs are correct. As expected, they <b>help time-limited human participants to more accurately and efficiently recognize when LLMs are correct</b>. However, interestingly, when LLMs are wrong, HoTs tend to fool users into believing that an answer is correct.

           Modern LLMs can bold, italicize or underline their text. Why not highlight as well? We propose Highlighted Chain-of-Thought Prompting (HoT), a technique for prompting LLMs to generate highlights around their responses that links specific information from the user query to the LLM response. This method <b>improves user experiences</b> and <b>improves answer accuracy</b> when compared to CoT.

            Containers and Visual Diagrams
        </h1>

        <p class="text">
            Most AI projects incorporate visual diagrams to effectively communicate complex concepts. These diagrams often highlight new neural architecture designs and ML training pipelines, which are central to the project's contributions and research highlights. Clear and well-designed diagrams can significantly enhance the reader's understanding and engagement with the research. In Clarity, texts and visual diagrams are wrapped within a div container to maintain consistent design layouts.
        </p>      
        
        <p class="text">
            Simple design modules, such as minor adjustments to a neural network block, can be directly embedded within the text in the same container, without additional captions. This approach helps readers comprehend the proposed concept in a seamless and integrated manner.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
            Here is an example I redesigned, illustrating the difference between standard and bottleneck residual blocks as proposed in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385">Residual Networks</a>.

        <p class="text">
            For more complex visual diagrams, such as detailed neural architecture designs, it is recommended to use a separate container with a distinct background colour. This ensures that diagrams stand out and are easily distinguishable from the main text. Additionally, a new caption style is provided to help explain each design detail clearly.

            LLMs are great at giving you intelligent responses to any question you have. However, it can be annoying to read through huge blocks of text. Humans frequently add color highlighting to our writing to make it easier to read, so why not allow LLMs to do the same thing?

            Consider this example. Which of these two responses are easier to read? For the response on the left, you have to parse through all the irrelevant context to find the part of the conversation that you care about. For the HoT response, you can almost instantly scan over the LLM responses to see exactly where it drew its answer from.

            We conduct a study with 63 people to evaluate the effectiveness of HoT in helping users verify the correctness of LLM answers. Users are randomly assigned to see exclusively HoT or CoT LLM response and then have to predict if the given answer is correct or incorrect. We found that HoT helps time-limited human participants to more accurately and efficiently recognize when LLMs are correct. However, when LLMs are wrong, HoTs tend to fool users into believing that an answer is correct.

        <h2>
            Why does HoT work?
        </h2>
        <p class="text">
            Part of the increase of accuracy in HoT can likely be attributed to repeating the question. Several papers (cite echo repeat) have shown that having the LLM repeat the input question before generating a response can improve performance. However, in our full paper we show that HoT has a higher performance than just repeating the question. 
        </p>

        <p class="text">
            We theorize that by generating extra tokens (in this case XML tags) around key facts helps the LLM to focus its attention to the most important context. Its also possible that by adding the XML tags, the LLM is more effectively able to recall specific information from earlier in its context window with less frequent hallucinations. However, more research is needed to verify these claims.
        </p>
        <h2>
            What about Reasoning Models?
        </h2>
        <p class="text">
            So if HoT can help LLMs to more effectively reason, how do reasoning models respond to this prompting strategy? Given the relatively high cost to run Deepseek R1 and the low rate limits of Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking, we were only able to run evaluations on a subset of benchmarks. However, we see no benefit to using HoT with these reasoning models.

        <p class="text">
            Given that HoT relies on fewshot examples, the negative results for Deepseek align with the warnings from the creators of R1 explicitly claim that fewshot examples can actually R1's performance. Interestingly, the <code>thinking</code> tokens for R1, do NOT contain XML tags, but its final answer does include XML tags. Gemini Flash 2.0 Thinking does not provide thinking tokens over the API, so we are not able to analyze its internal Chain of Thought.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
           If trained to use XML tags in its <code>thinking</code> tokens, HoT could potentially be a useful tool for reasoning models to ground facts over long contexts. However, the current reasoning models do not benefit from HoT.

            Limitations
        </h2>
        <p class="text">
            The biggest limitation for HoT is its reliance on few shot examples. On our Github, we have gathered plenty of fewshot examles that can be applied to most domains. However if you have a niche task that you want to apply HoT on, you have to first construct the fewshot examples yourself. However, this could be easily fixed in future work with a finetuned model that produces HoT responses by default.

            We present Highlighted Chain of Thought, a novel prompting approach that enables LLMs to directly reference text from the input question in their responses. Our experiments show that on average, HoT improves arithmetic, question answering, and logical reasoning tasks by <span class="good">+1.6</span>, <span class="good">+2.58</span>, and <span class="good">+2.53</span> percentage points over CoT while also enabling users to verify correct LLM answers <span class="good">24% faster</span> than CoT LLM answers.
