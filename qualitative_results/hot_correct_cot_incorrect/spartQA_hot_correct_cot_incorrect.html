The big blue triangle is touching the right edge of this block. This shape is below and to the right of the big black square. Which object is to the right of a big black square? the blue thing that is touching the right edge of a block or the medium yellow circle?
(a) the blue thing that is touching the right edge of  a block 
(b) the medium yellow circle 
(c) both of them
(d) none of them<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Block A contains a medium yellow square touching the bottom edge, a big blue triangle below a medium blue triangle and near a big black circle. Block B, below A, has a big black square. Block C, to the left of B, has a big blue triangle touching the right edge and a medium yellow circle. The question asks what is to the right of the big black square.  Since Block C is to the left of Block B, the objects within Block C cannot be to the right of the big black square. Therefore, neither the blue triangle nor the medium yellow circle are to the right of the big black square.

(a) the medium yellow square  that is touching the bottom edge of a block 
(b) the medium yellow square  that is in block C
(c) both of them
(d) none of them<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Block A contains a medium blue square and a medium black square. Block B (to the right of A) contains two medium yellow squares. Block C (above A) contains two medium blue squares and a medium yellow square. The question asks what is to the left of *a* medium yellow square.  Since there are three medium yellow squares, we need to consider each one. The medium yellow squares in Block B are to the right of the shapes in Block A, so the shapes in Block A are to the left of the medium yellow squares in Block B. The medium yellow square in Block C is above the medium blue square in Block A, so the medium blue square is below, not to the left of it. Only the medium yellow squares in block B have something to their left, which includes the medium yellow square in Block C.

Since the question doesn't specify which black square we're considering, we must look at both. The medium black square in <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Block B</fact4> is above <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">yellow squares</fact5>, not blue ones, so <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">the medium blue square in Block A</fact3> and <fact10 style="background-color: #FF335E;">medium blue square number two</fact10> (in <fact8 style="background-color: #8D33FF;">Block C</fact8>) are not below the medium black square in <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Block B</fact4>. The medium black square in <fact8 style="background-color: #8D33FF;">Block C</fact8>, however, is above <fact10 style="background-color: #FF335E;">medium blue square number two</fact10>. Therefore, the answer is {B}.<br><br><strong>GT:</strong>B</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='cot_answer'><strong>40/ Question:</strong> We have three blocks. Lets call them A, B and C. Block B is to the left of A. Block A is below C. Block A has one medium black square and a medium blue square. This block also has one medium yellow square. The medium black square is touching the bottom edge of this block. This shape is below the medium blue square and the medium yellow square. The medium blue square is below the medium yellow square. Block B has two medium blue squares. Below medium blue square number two there is medium blue square number one. Block C has two medium yellow squares. Below a medium blue square there is medium yellow square number one. Medium yellow square number two is below the medium blue square. Medium yellow square number one is touching the bottom edge of this block. It is below the medium yellow square number two. Which object is to the left of a medium yellow square? medium blue square number one or the medium blue square which is in block C?
(a) medium blue square  number one
(b) the medium blue square  which is in block C
(c) both of them
(d) none of them<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Block B contains two medium blue squares, numbered one and two. Block C contains two medium yellow squares and a medium blue square. Since Block B is to the left of Block A and Block A is below Block C, Block B is to the left of both Block A and Block C.  The question asks what is to the left of *a* medium yellow square, implying any of the medium yellow squares. Since Block B (with its medium blue squares) is to the left of Block C (which contains medium yellow squares), both medium blue square number one and the medium blue square in Block C are to the left of a medium yellow square.

Answer: {C}

(a) the big object that is touching the bottom edge of a block 
(b) the medium yellow circle 
(c) both of them
(d) none of them<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Here's the breakdown:

1. **Block A:** Contains a medium black triangle.
2. **Block B (above A):** Contains a big blue triangle touching the bottom edge, a medium blue circle, and a medium black triangle to the left of the big blue triangle.
3. **Block C (above B):** Contains a small yellow square touching the right edge, a medium yellow circle, a medium blue triangle, and a medium black square.

The question asks what is above the medium black triangle. The medium black triangle is in Block B.  Above Block B is Block C, which contains the medium yellow circle. The big blue triangle touching the bottom edge of Block B is in the same block as the medium black triangle, not above it. Therefore, only the medium yellow circle is above the medium black triangle.

(d) none of them<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Block A has a medium yellow square. Block B has two medium black squares and a medium yellow square. Medium black square number one is at the bottom, below medium black square number two, which is below the medium yellow square. Block C has a medium blue square and a medium yellow square, with the medium yellow square below both the medium black square and the medium blue square. The question asks what is below the medium yellow square in Block B.  It's stated that medium black square number two is below the medium yellow square, and medium black square number one is below medium black square number two (and therefore also below the medium yellow square).  Since medium black square number one is described as touching the bottom edge, it is the one directly below the medium yellow square. Medium black square number two is also below the medium yellow square, but not touching the bottom edge.

Medium blue square number one is at the very bottom of Block A, with medium blue square number two, medium black square number one, and medium black square number two layered above it in that order. Block B, which is below Block A, has a medium yellow square. Since Block B is directly below Block A, the shapes in Block A are above the medium yellow square in Block B. The question asks what is above the medium yellow square. Since medium blue square number one is at the bottom of Block A and medium blue square number two is above it, neither of them is directly above the medium yellow square in Block B.

<div class='container'><div class='cot_answer'><strong>314/ Question:</strong> We have three blocks. We call them A, B and C. Block C is to the right of B and block A is above C. Block A has one medium yellow triangle, a medium black square and a big blue triangle. The medium black square is above the big blue triangle. The big blue triangle is touching the right edge of this block. The medium yellow triangle is to the left of and below the medium black square. The medium black square is touching the right edge of this block. Block B contains a medium blue circle. Block C contains one medium black square, a small black triangle and one medium yellow triangle. The medium black square is below and to the left of the small black triangle which is near to the medium yellow triangle. What is below the big thing? a medium yellow triangle or a medium black square which is touching the right edge of a block?
(a) medium yellow triangle 
(b) medium black square  which is touching the right edge of  a block 
(c) both of them
(d) none of them<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Block A contains the big blue triangle, which is described as the "big thing".  Block C, which is below Block A, contains a medium black square and a medium yellow triangle. Therefore, both are below the big blue triangle.  The medium black square in Block A is not relevant since the question asks about what is below the big *thing* (the big blue triangle).

<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Block A</fact3> contains the <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">big blue triangle</fact6> (<fact14 style="background-color: #75FF33;">the big thing</fact14>), which is touching the right edge (<fact8 style="background-color: #8D33FF;">fact 8</fact8>). <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Block A is above Block C</fact2>.  Block C contains a <fact11 style="background-color: #3378FF;">medium black square</fact11> and a <fact12 style="background-color: #FFB833;">medium yellow triangle</fact12>.  According to <fact13 style="background-color: #FF33F5;">fact 13</fact13>, the <fact11 style="background-color: #3378FF;">medium black square</fact11> is to the left of the small black triangle and hence, not at the right edge. Since <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Block C is below Block A</fact2>, the <fact12 style="background-color: #FFB833;">medium yellow triangle</fact12> and the <fact11 style="background-color: #3378FF;">medium black square</fact11> in Block C are indeed below objects in Block A. The <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">big blue triangle</fact6> (<fact14 style="background-color: #75FF33;">the big thing</fact14>) is on the right edge of <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Block A</fact3> (<fact8 style="background-color: #8D33FF;">fact 8</fact8>). Given that Block C has a <fact12 style="background-color: #FFB833;">medium yellow triangle</fact12> and a <fact11 style="background-color: #3378FF;">medium black square</fact11>, and Block C is <fact14 style="background-color: #75FF33;">below Block A</fact14>, a medium yellow triangle could be below the <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">big blue triangle</fact6>. However, we are also asked if a <fact11 style="background-color: #3378FF;">medium black square</fact11> touching the right edge of a block is below it. Since <fact13 style="background-color: #FF33F5;">the medium black square is on the left side of Block C</fact13>, it cannot be touching the right edge.
