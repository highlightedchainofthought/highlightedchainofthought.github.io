There, Rachel learned that 703 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day. If there were 246 visitors on that day, how many visited the Buckingham palace within 25 days?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Rachel learned there were 703 visitors the previous day, and there were 246 visitors *that* day.  The question asks how many visited within 25 days, but we only have information for two days. We'll assume they're asking for the total visitors over those two days.
Total visitors = 703 (previous day) + 246 (current day) = 949 visitors.

Answer: {949}

Answer: 
 <br><br>The question is asking for the number of visitors within <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">25 days</fact3>, but the provided information relates to daily visitor numbers (<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">246 visitors on that day</fact2>).  The information about the previous day's visitors (<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">703 visitors</fact1>) is irrelevant.  Therefore, if there were <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">246 visitors on that day</fact2>, and assuming this is the average daily number of visitors, then over <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">25 days</fact3> there would be <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">246</fact2> * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">25</fact3> = 6150 visitors.

Answer:

 <br><br>There were initially <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">3 orchids</fact2> and now there are <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">7 orchids</fact3>.  This means Jessica added 7 - 3 = 4 orchids. The question asks how many she *cut*. Since she *added* orchids, she cut 0 orchids.  It seems like there's an error in the question itself, as it implies she cut some, but the numbers suggest she added some. If she added 4, she cut 0.

<div class='container'><div class='cot_answer'><strong>289/ Question:</strong> After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There were 71 paintings in the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 557 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 188 visitors the previous day, how many visited the Buckingham palace within 57 days?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Explanation:
The question asks for the number of visitors to Buckingham Palace within 57 days. However, we're only given the number of visitors for two days. We don't have enough information to determine the number of visitors over 57 days. The information about the number of paintings is irrelevant.

Assuming the question meant to ask about the total visitors over the two days mentioned:
Day 1: 188 visitors
Day 2: 557 visitors
Total visitors over the two days: 188 + 557 = 745 visitors

The provided information about <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">71 paintings</fact1> and <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">188 visitors the previous day</fact3> is irrelevant to calculating the number of visitors within 57 days. The question also does not specify if the <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">557 visitors that day</fact2> is part of the 57-day period. Therefore, the question cannot be answered with the information provided.  We only know the number of visitors on a single specific day (<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">557</fact2>).

<div class='container'><div class='cot_answer'><strong>348/ Question:</strong> Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Together they collected strawberries that weighed 22 pounds. On the way back Marco ' dad found 30 more pounds of strawberries. Marco's strawberries now weighed 36 pounds. How much did his dad's strawberries weigh now?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Marco and his dad initially collected 22 pounds of strawberries.  Let's say Marco collected 'x' pounds and his dad collected 'y' pounds. So, x + y = 22.

Marco's dad found 30 more pounds. These 30 pounds were added to his dad's collection.
Marco's total weight became 36 pounds. This means he gained 36 - x pounds.

Since the total weight initially was 22 pounds, and Marco's dad found 30 more pounds, the new total weight is 22 + 30 = 52 pounds.

We know Marco now has 36 pounds, so his dad must have the remaining weight.
Dad's weight = Total weight - Marco's weight
Dad's weight = 52 - 36 = 16 pounds.

Answer: {16}

Answer:

 <br><br>Together, Marco and his dad initially picked <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">22 pounds</fact1> of strawberries.  Since <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Marco now has 36 pounds</fact3>, his dad must have given him 36 - <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">22</fact1> = 14 pounds. This means the dad originally had <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">22</fact1> - (36-<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">22</fact1>) = 8 pounds.  Then he found <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">30 more pounds</fact2>.  So now his dad has 8 + <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">30</fact2> = 38 pounds of strawberries.

John did 54 - 9 = 45 push-ups.
Zachary did 15 push-ups and John did 45 push-ups.

Answer:

 <br><br>David did <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">39 more push-ups than Zachary</fact2>, who did <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">15 push-ups</fact1>, so David did <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">15</fact1> + <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">39</fact2> = 54 push-ups. John did <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">9 push-ups less than David</fact3>, so John did 54 - <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">9</fact3> = 45 push-ups.  Zachary did <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">15 push-ups</fact1> and John did 45, so Zachary did 45 - <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">15</fact1> = 30 fewer push-ups than John (or John did 30 more than Zachary).

Since the cave descends 919 feet down, and then goes horizontally for another 1307 feet, those two distances added together will give us the total distance from the entrance to the end.

Answer: 
 <br><br>This question seems to be asking how much further they need to travel to reach the end of the cave.  They need to travel a total of <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1307 feet</fact2>, and the cave is <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">919 feet deep</fact1>.  This means the end of the cave is <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1307</fact2> - <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">919</fact1> = 388 feet further.

If there are a total of 12 chairs in the backyard, how many chairs are there for each table?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>They have 2 sets of tables. Let 'x' be the number of chairs per table. Since there are 2 sets of tables, there are 2 * x chairs in total.  We are given that there are 12 chairs in total. Therefore, 2 * x = 12. Dividing both sides by 2 gives x = 6.  So, there are 6 chairs for each table.

Answer: 
 <br><br>There are <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">12 chairs total</fact2> and <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">2 sets of tables</fact1>. Since each set has the same number of chairs, there are 12 / 2 = 6 chairs per set of tables.  The question asks how many chairs are at *each* table, implying each *individual* table.  Since the problem doesn't specify how many tables are in a set, we can't determine how many chairs are at each table.  We only know there are 6 chairs per *set* of tables.
