If he had 13 crackers and 15 cakes initially, how many crackers and cakes did each person eat?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Matthew had 13 crackers and 15 cakes. He cannot divide 13 crackers and 15 cakes equally among 28 friends without cutting the crackers and cakes into fractions. It is implicitly assumed in the problem that each friend must receive a whole number of crackers and cakes. Since 13 and 15 are not evenly divisible by 28, some crackers and cakes will be left over.
However, if the question intends to ask how many crackers and cakes Matthew *gave out* in total, we can proceed as follows: Since he gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to each friend, he could give a maximum of 0 crackers and 0 cakes to each friend. This means he gave out a total of 0 crackers and 0 cakes.

Answer: {0 crackers and 0 cakes}

Answer: 
 <br><br>This question seems to be flawed.  It states Matthew gave *equal* numbers of crackers and cakes to each friend.  He started with <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">13 crackers</fact2> and <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">15 cakes</fact3>.  Since he has unequal amounts to begin with, he cannot give equal amounts of each to his <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">28 friends</fact1> unless he throws some away or eats some himself (which isn't mentioned).  If he gave away as many equal sets of crackers and cakes as possible, he could give 13 sets (limited by the number of crackers). This would mean 1 cracker and 1 cake per person for 13 people, with 15 - 13 = 2 cakes left over and 28 - 13 = 15 friends not receiving anything. If the question is asking how many total snacks each person ate, and assuming the remaining friends didn't receive anything, the 13 friends ate 1+1=2 snacks each.

If you read 19 of the movies and watched 16 of the books, how many more movies than books have you read?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Explanation: The question states there are 8 books and 5 movies. It then says you *read* 19 movies and *watched* 16 books. This is a trick question, playing on the usual association of "reading" with books and "watching" with movies.  You can't read a movie or watch a book. You read 0 movies. You watched/read 16 books. Therefore, you have read 16-0=16 more books than movies.

How many customers does he still have?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>The waiter started with 12 customers. 15 customers left, but this doesn't make sense as he can't have negative customers. We interpret this as him losing all 12 of his original customers, with 3 of the leaving customers not originally his. He then gained 14 new customers. So he now has 14 customers.
Answer: {14}
</div><div class='hot_answer'><strong>60/ Reformatted Question:</strong> A waiter had <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">12 customers</fact1>. While <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">15 customers left</fact2>, he got <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">14 new customers</fact3>. How many customers does he still have?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Reformatted Question: 
Answer: 
 <br><br>The waiter initially had <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">12 customers</fact1>.  Since <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">15 customers left</fact2>, this leaves him with 12 - 15 = -3 customers.  However, it is not possible for a waiter to have negative 3 customers. The question states that <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">15 customers left</fact2> the initial 12 customers, which implies that the number of leaving customers couldn't exceed the initial number. However, he then got <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">14 new customers</fact3>, so the total number of customers he has is -3 + 14 = 11. If we ignore the physically impossible scenario, and focus on the net change after the initial 12, we have -15 + 14 = -1 customer, so he would have 12 -1 = 11 customers.

Then there were 12 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got off the bus than those that got on?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Initially, there were 36 children on the bus.  68 children got off, so there were 36 - 68 = -32 children. This means there were no children left on the bus, and in fact 32 *more* children got off than were on the bus to begin with.

After the 68 children got off and some got on, there were 12 children on the bus.  Since there were effectively 0 children on the bus after the 68 got off, this means 12 children got on.

The difference between the number of children who got off and the number who got on is 68 - 12 = 56.

<div class='container'><div class='cot_answer'><strong>498/ Question:</strong> 5 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 63 children got off the bus while some more got on the bus. Then there were 14 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Initially, there were 5 children on the bus.
63 children got off the bus, so there were 5 - 63 = -58 children. This means the bus was empty.
Then, some children got on, and the total became 14. So, 14 children got on the bus.
The difference between the number of children who got on and those who got off is 14 - 63 = -49.
However, the question asks how many *more* got on than got off.  Since 14 got on and 63 got off, 63-14 = 49 *fewer* children got on compared to the number who got off, or 49 *more* got off than got on.  So we are looking for a positive number.  We can conclude that 49 *more* children got off the bus than got on the bus.  
The wording of the problem has an issue: the number of children can't be negative.  It must be the case that more children got on the bus than got off.
At the first stop, 63 children got off the bus, leaving 5-63=-58. It's not possible for the number of children on the bus to be negative.
Let's assume that the 5 children initially on the bus was a typo, and there were 68 children on the bus.
63 got off, leaving 68-63=5. Then some more got on, for a total of 14. Thus 14-5=9 more children got on.
The question asks how many more children got on than got off, which is 9-63=-54.
Let's calculate how many got on. After the 63 got off, there were 14-63 = -49. Because the number of kids cannot be negative, we can't find how many more children got on the bus than those that got off. Assuming the question meant how many more children got off than got on the answer would be 63 - 14 = 49.
Given that the question must have a real answer, we are going to work backwards. At the end of the problem, there are 14 students on the bus. If 63 students got off, there must have been 14+63=77 students on the bus originally, not 5. So 5 is incorrect. 63 students got off, and there were originally 77 students. That means at that stop, 14-0=14 students got on the bus. The question is How many more children got on the bus than those that got off? So, 63-14 =49 more got off than on.

Answer: {49}

Jessica threw away 34 roses from the vase and cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. There are now 15 roses in the vase. How many more roses did she throw away than those she cut from her garden?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Jessica threw away 34 roses, but there were only 21 in the vase. This means she must have thrown away all 21 roses that were originally in the vase, and then also discarded an additional 34 - 21 = 13 roses from somewhere else.  After discarding the roses, she had 0 roses. She then added roses until there were 15.  Therefore, she cut 15 roses.  She threw away 13 more roses (from somewhere other than the vase) than she cut.

Answer: {13}
</div><div class='hot_answer'><strong>844/ Reformatted Question:</strong> There were <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">21 roses</fact1> in the vase. Jessica threw away <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">34 roses</fact2> from the vase and cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. There are now <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">15 roses</fact3> in the vase. How many more roses did she throw away than those she cut from her garden?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Reformatted Question: 

Answer:

 <br><br>Initially, there were <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">21 roses</fact1>. Jessica threw away <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">34 roses</fact2>.  Since she threw away more than she initially had, she must have added some roses before discarding them.  To find out how many she added before discarding, we calculate the difference between the number she discarded (<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">34</fact2>) and the initial number (<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">21</fact1>): <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">34</fact2> - <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">21</fact1> = 13.  This means 13 roses must have been added before she threw any away.

After discarding the roses, she had 0. Then she added some more, and ended up with <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">15 roses</fact3>. This means she added 15 roses after discarding the initial batch.

In total, she added 13 + 15 = 28 roses.  She threw away <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">34 roses</fact2>. The difference between the number she threw away and the number she cut and added is <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">34</fact2> - 28 = 6. So she threw away 6 more roses than she cut from her garden. The answer is {6}.<br><br><strong>GT:</strong>6.0</div></div>
