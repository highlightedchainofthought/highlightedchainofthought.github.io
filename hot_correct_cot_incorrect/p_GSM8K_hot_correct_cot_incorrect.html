He also gets <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">5 games</fact4> for Christmas every year. He saves up enough money to buy <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">1 game per month</fact5> for a <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">year</fact6>, and then the <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">second year</fact7> he starts buying <fact8 style="background-color: #8D33FF;">2 games a month</fact8>. How many games does Steve have <fact9 style="background-color: #33FF8D;">after 3 years</fact9>?

**<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>**Reformatted Question:Answer:
 <br><br>**

Here's the breakdown of how many games Steve accumulates over three years:

* **Initial games:** Steve starts with <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">5 games</fact1>.
* **Year 1:** He buys <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">1 game per month</fact5> for 12 months, totaling 1 * 12 = 12 games. He also receives <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">5 games</fact4> for Christmas.
* **Year 2:** He buys <fact8 style="background-color: #8D33FF;">2 games per month</fact8> for 12 months, totaling 2 * 12 = 24 games.  He also receives another <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">5 games</fact4> for Christmas.
* **Year 3:** He buys <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">4 games per month</fact3> for 12 months, totaling 4 * 12 = 48 games.  He gets another <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">5 games</fact4> for Christmas.

**Total:**

* **Year 1:** <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">5</fact1> (initial) + 12 + <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">5</fact4> = 22 games
* **Year 2:** 22 + 24 + <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">5</fact4> = 51 games
* **Year 3:** 51 + 48 + <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">5</fact4> = 104 games

Therefore, Steve has 104 games <fact9 style="background-color: #33FF8D;">after 3 years</fact9>. The answer is {104}.<br><br><strong>GT:</strong>104.0</div></div>

If he has <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">two bags</fact5> of glass chips, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?

Answer:
Milo has <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">two bags</fact5> of chips, and each bag holds <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">72 chips</fact1>, so he has 2 * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">72</fact1> = 144 chips.  Since it takes <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">12 chips</fact3> for every <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">square inch</fact4>, he has enough chips for 144 / <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">12</fact3> = 12 square inches.  He wants the mosaic to be <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">3 inches tall</fact2>, so to find the length, we divide the total area (12 square inches) by the height (<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">3 inches</fact2>): 12 / <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">3</fact2> = 4 inches.  Therefore, the mosaic can be 4 inches long.

Answer: {12}</div><div class='hot_answer'><strong>12/ Reformatted Question:</strong> **

John decides to do several activities while out on vacation.  He spent <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">40% of his time sightseeing</fact1>. He spent <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">30% of the time</fact2> with the following events. He spends <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">6 hours boating</fact3> and <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">half that time swimming</fact4>.  He also <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each</fact5>.  How much time did he spend sightseeing?

**<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>**Reformatted Question:Answer:
 <br><br>**

First, calculate the time spent swimming: <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Half</fact4> of the <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">6 hours</fact3> spent boating is <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">6</fact3> / 2 = 3 hours.

Next, calculate the time spent watching shows: <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">3 shows * 2 hours/show</fact5> = 6 hours.

Now, find the total time spent on the activities besides sightseeing: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">6 hours (boating)</fact3> + 3 hours (swimming) + 6 hours (shows) = 15 hours.

These activities (boating, swimming, and shows) represent <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">30% of his total vacation time</fact2>.  Therefore, 15 hours is equal to 30% of the total time. To find 100% of the time (the total vacation time), set up a proportion:

15 hours / 30% = x hours / 100%

Solving for x: x = (15 hours * 100%) / 30% = 50 hours

Finally, calculate the time spent sightseeing, which is <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">40% of the total vacation time</fact1>: 50 hours * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">40%</fact1> = 20 hours.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Explanation: First find the total distance Kelly runs: 100 yards + 34 runs * 40 yards/run * 2 (there and back) = 2820 yards. Then multiply the number of times Blake ran back and forth by the distance of the football field to find the total distance he ran: 15 runs * 100 yards/run = 1500 yards. Then subtract the shorter distance from the longer distance to find the difference: 2820 yards - 1500 yards = 1320 yards.

She does this <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">34 times</fact5>. Blake runs back and forth <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">15 times</fact6>. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?

                    Answer:

Kelly runs the length of the field and back <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">once</fact3>, so she runs <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">100 yards</fact2> * 2 = 200 yards.  Then, she runs to the <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">40-yard line</fact4> and back <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">34 times</fact5>. Each of these runs is <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">40 yards</fact4> * 2 = 80 yards.  So, for these runs, she travels 80 yards * <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">34</fact5> = 2720 yards. In total, Kelly runs 200 yards + 2720 yards = 2920 yards.

Blake runs back and forth <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">15 times</fact6>.  Each back and forth is <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">100 yards</fact2> * 2 = 200 yards. So, he runs a total of 200 yards * <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">15</fact6> = 3000 yards.

Blake runs farther than Kelly. The difference is 3000 yards - 2920 yards = 80 yards. The answer is {80}.<br><br><strong>GT:</strong>80.0</div></div>

<div class='container'><div class='cot_answer'><strong>22/ Question:</strong> Today is December 31st. For a New Year's resolution, Andy wants to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday, which is July 19th. If Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Explanation: First, figure out how many days Andy has to lose weight: July is 7 months into the year, and his birthday is on the 19th, giving him 7*30+19 = 229 days. However, January has 31 days, not 30, so add one more day: 229 + 1 = 230 days.  Subtract the remaining days in December to find the total number of days Andy has to lose weight: 230 - 1 = 229 days.

Next, calculate Andy's total calorie deficit by multiplying the number of pounds he wants to lose by the number of calories he needs to burn per pound: 30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105000 calories.

Finally, divide Andy's total calorie deficit by the number of days he has to lose weight to find his daily calorie deficit: 105000 calories / 229 days = 458.5 calories/day.

If Andy needs to burn <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">3500 calories</fact3> to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?

**<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>**Reformatted Question:Answer:
 <br><br>**

First, we need to calculate the number of days between December 31st and July 19th.  There are 31 days in January, 28 in February (since it's not a leap year), 31 in March, 30 in April, 31 in May, 30 in June, and 19 in July.  So, the total number of days is 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days.

Andy wants to lose <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">30 lbs</fact1>, and it takes a <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">3500 calorie</fact3> deficit to lose one pound. Therefore, he needs to create a total calorie deficit of <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">30</fact1> * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">3500</fact3> = 105,000 calories.

Since he has 200 days (<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">until July 19th</fact2>) to achieve this, his daily calorie deficit should be 105,000 / 200 = 525 calories per day.

Boris <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">produces 8,000 bars of chocolate the first week</fact2>. How <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">much does he produce the fourth week</fact3>?

The total number of bars of chocolate Boris produces in the first week is <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">8,000</fact2>.  In the second week, he produces half as much, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars. In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">8,000</fact2> * 3 = 24,000 bars.  The total production for the first three weeks is <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">8,000</fact2> + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.  Since Boris produces a total of <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">50,000 bars each month</fact1>, and assuming a month has four weeks, the number of bars produced in the fourth week is <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">50,000</fact1> - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

* **Step 2: Calculate the battery charge before the last 3 hours.**  Before the last 3 hours, the battery was at 28% + 21% = 49%.
* **Step 3:  Calculate how much battery was used in the first 5 hours.** This means the battery went from 100% down to 49% in 5 hours, a loss of 100% - 49% = 51%.
* **Step 4: Calculate the battery loss per hour during the first 5 hours.** Over 5 hours, the battery lost 51%, so it was losing 51% / 5 hours = 10.2% per hour. 
* **Step 5:  Determine if the battery was fully charged when Maria left for the park.** Since the battery was losing charge at a rate of 10.2% per hour and it was at 49% after 5 hours, it means it was not fully charged when she left.

Answer: {The power bank was not fully charged when Maria went to the park.}

What was the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park?

Answer:
Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park as 'x'.

First, the power bank lost 9% per hour for 5 hours (<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">5 hours after</fact3>). So the total percentage lost during this period is 9% * 5 = 45%.

Then, the power bank lost 7% per hour for 3 hours (<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">lose instead 7% ... for about 3 hours</fact4>). So the total percentage lost during this period is 7% * 3 = 21%.

The total percentage lost is 45% + 21% = 66%.

The final charge is given as 28% (<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">charge remaining was 28%</fact2>). This means that x - 66% = 28%.

Therefore, the initial charge 'x' was 28% + 66% = 94%.  So the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%.

The answer is {94}.<br><br><strong>GT:</strong>94.0</div></div>

She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each.  She then adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each.  As she's carrying these flowers over to fill the vase, she drops 1 of each and the wind blows them away.  Lastly she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each. She also drops 1 of these flowers.  She puts the remaining flowers in the vase.  How many petals in total are on the flowers in the vase?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Explanation: Rose started with 3 flowers * 5 petals/flower = 15 petals.
Then she added 4 flowers * 6 petals/flower = 24 petals.
Next she added 5 flowers * 4 petals/flower = 20 petals.
At this point she had 15 petals + 24 petals + 20 petals = 59 petals.
She lost 3 flowers total, so she lost 3 petals from dropping and having the wind blow them away.
She had 59 petals - 3 petals = 56 petals remaining.
Her last group of flowers added 6 flowers * 7 petals/flower = 42 petals.
She dropped one of these flowers, so she lost 7 petals.
This left her with 42 petals - 7 petals = 35 petals.
In total she had 56 petals + 35 petals = 91 petals.

How many checks does Buford write <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">per year</fact5>?

The question asks how many checks Buford writes <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">per year</fact5>.

Gas bill: He writes one check <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">every month</fact1>, which is 1 check * 12 months/<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">year</fact5> = 12 checks <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">per year</fact5>.
Pest and lawn service: He writes one check <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">quarterly</fact2>, which is 1 check * 4 quarters/<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">year</fact5> = 4 checks <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">per year</fact5>.
Electric bill: He writes one check <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">once per month</fact3>, so this is another 1 check * 12 months/<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">year</fact5> = 12 checks <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">per year</fact5>.
Church: He writes a check <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">twice per month</fact4>, so this is 2 checks * 12 months/<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">year</fact5> = 24 checks <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">per year</fact5>.

In total, Buford writes 12 + 4 + 12 + 24 = 52 checks <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">per year</fact5>.

If the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. There's a 50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Explanation:
First find the probability that Marcus will *not* get an extension from the normal teacher: 100% - 40% = 60%
Then multiply that probability by the probability that his dog ate his assignment story won't work to find the probability he'll have to do the homework if the normal teacher is there: 60% * 80% = 48%
Then multiply the probability of having a substitute by the probability he won't have to do the homework if there is a substitute to find the probability he won't have to do it if there's a sub: 50% * 100% = 50%
Then subtract that percentage from 100% to find the probability he will have to do it if there's a sub: 100% - 50% = 50%

 <br><br>Marcus is trying to decide whether he really needs to do his homework. If the <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">normal teacher</fact1> comes in, there's a <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">40%</fact2> chance she'll give everyone an extension. There's a <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">50%</fact3> chance that tomorrow he'll have a <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">substitute teacher</fact4> who won't collect the homework. Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">20%</fact5> chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?

                         Answer:
There is a <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">50%</fact3> chance that Marcus will have a <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">substitute teacher</fact4> who won't collect the homework, so there is a 100% - <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">50%</fact3> = 50% chance that the <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">normal teacher</fact1> will come. If the <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">normal teacher</fact1> comes, there is a <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">40%</fact2> chance of a class-wide extension. This means there is a 100% - <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">40%</fact2> = 60% chance the class won't get an extension. In that case, Marcus has a <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">20%</fact5> chance of getting a personal extension, which means he has a 100% - <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">20%</fact5> = 80% chance of having to turn in the homework.
The chance of the <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">normal teacher</fact1> coming AND no class extension AND no personal extension is 50% * 60% * 80% = 24%.
So there is a 24% chance Marcus will have to turn in his homework. The answer is {24}.<br><br><strong>GT:</strong>24.0</div></div>

After 10 years, Tom plants 10 trees/year * 10 years = 100 trees
Adding the trees he started with, he has a total of 100 trees + 50 trees = 150 trees
30% of his trees died, so he lost 150 trees * .30 = 45 trees
After the trees died, he had 150 trees - 45 trees = 105 trees
He chops down 2 trees every year for 10 years for a total of 2 trees/year * 10 years = 20 trees
After chopping down trees, he has 105 trees - 20 trees = 85 trees remaining.

Every year he also chops down <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">2 trees a year</fact5>. How many trees does he have left?

After <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">10 years</fact3>, Tom has planted <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">10 trees/year</fact1> * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">10 years</fact3> = 100 trees.

She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance and the same amount of salt as sugar. She makes enough to fill a 10-ounce jar each time. She uses twice as much oil as salt and twice as much salt as zest. How many ounces of oil does she use?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Explanation:
Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) Tanya uses.**

* **Salt and sugar:** She uses the same amount of salt and sugar as each other, and this amount is twice the amount of zest. So, she uses 2*x ounces of salt and 2*x ounces of sugar.

* **Oil:**  She uses twice as much oil as salt. Since she uses 2*x ounces of salt, she uses 2 * (2*x) = 4*x ounces of oil.

**To find the amount of oil, we need to find the value of 'x'.  However, we don't have enough information to determine the exact proportions of each ingredient in the 10-ounce jar.  We only know the *ratios* of ingredients to one another.**

 <br><br>Tanya makes a salt scrub from salt, oil, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar. She uses <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance</fact1> and <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">the same amount of salt as sugar</fact2>. She makes enough to fill a <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">10-ounce jar</fact3> each time. She uses <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">twice as much oil as salt</fact4> and <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">twice as much salt as zest</fact5>. How many ounces of oil does she use?

Let's use variables:
* Z = amount of zest
* F = amount of fragrance
* S = amount of salt
* Su = amount of sugar
* O = amount of oil

From <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">, we know Z = F.
From <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">, we know S = Su.
From <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">, we know S = 2Z.
From <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">, we know O = 2S.

Since the total amount of ingredients is <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">10 ounces</fact3>, we have Z + F + S + Su + O = 10.

Substitute the known relationships:
Z + Z + S + S + O = 10
2Z + 2S + O = 10

Now substitute S = 2Z:
2Z + 2(2Z) + O = 10
2Z + 4Z + O = 10
6Z + O = 10

Finally, substitute O = 2S = 2(2Z) = 4Z:
6Z + 4Z = 10
10Z = 10
Z = 1

Now, we can find the amount of oil:
O = 4Z = 4 * 1 = 4 ounces

 <br><br>There are <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">6 periods</fact1> in the day for a normal student. Each class is <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">40 minutes</fact2> long.

How many hours a week does he spend learning, if John has to take <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">2 extra classes</fact6> a day?

                    Answer:

A normal student has <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">6 periods</fact1> a day, but John takes <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">2 extra classes</fact6>, so he has 6 + <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">2</fact6> = 8 classes per day.  Each class is <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">40 minutes</fact2> long, so he spends 8 * <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">40</fact2> = 320 minutes per day in class. He goes to class for <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">5 days</fact3> a week, meaning he spends 320 * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">5</fact3> = 1600 minutes in class each week.  This is his weekly class time.

To calculate his weekend learning time, we need to find his weekly class time in minutes, which we calculated as 1600 minutes. He spends <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">1/16</fact4> of this time each on <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Saturday and Sunday</fact5>, so he spends (1/16) * 1600 = 100 minutes each day of the weekend studying. Since there are two weekend days (<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Saturday and Sunday</fact5>), he spends 100 * 2 = 200 minutes studying on the weekends.

His total weekly learning time is the sum of his weekday class time and weekend study time: 1600 + 200 = 1800 minutes.

The question asks for the answer in hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, his total weekly learning time is 1800 / 60 = 30 hours.

**<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>**Reformatted Question:Answer:
 <br><br>**

Brinley's lowest score on her <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">first five tests</fact4> is <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">71</fact3>. Since Mr. Bert drops the lowest score, we <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">remove the 71</fact2> from consideration.  The sum of her remaining <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">four scores</fact4> is <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367</fact3>.

To achieve an <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">average of 93</fact6> over <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">five tests</fact1> (after the lowest is dropped), the sum of those <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">five scores</fact1> must be 93 * 5 = 465.

Let 'x' be the score Brinley needs on her <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">sixth test</fact5>.  Since we already know the sum of her four highest scores is 367,  we can set up the equation: 367 + x = 465.

Solving for x, we get x = 465 - 367 = 98. Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 98 on her <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">sixth test</fact5> to have an <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">average of 93</fact6>. The answer is {98}.<br><br><strong>GT:</strong>98.0</div></div>

How many bandages did they start with on the first day?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Explanation: Here's how we can solve this problem:

* **Third day:** They used half a bulk pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.
* **Total used in the first three days:**  They had 78 bandages left and used 25 on the third day, so they used a total of 78 + 25 = 103 bandages in the first three days.
* **Second day:** They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, meaning they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
* **Total used in the first two days:**  They used 38 on the first day and 28 on the second day, for a total of 38 + 28 = 66 bandages.
* **Bandages after the first order:** Since they used 103 bandages in total and 66 in the first two days, they must have used 103 - 66 = 37 bandages after the first order.

                                                Answer:

Here's how we can figure out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day:

1. **Third Day Calculations:**
    * They ordered two bulk packs, adding 2 * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">50</fact1> = 100 bandages.
    * They used half a pack, meaning they used <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">50</fact1> / 2 = 25 bandages.

2. **Second Day Calculations:**
    * They used <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">ten fewer</fact4> bandages than the first day, so they used <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">38</fact5> - <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">10</fact4> = 28 bandages.

3. **First Day Calculations:**
    * They used <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">38 bandages</fact5>.
    * They ordered one bulk pack, adding <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">50</fact1> bandages.

4. **Working Backwards:**
    * At the end of the third day, they had <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">78</fact7> bandages.
    * Before using half a pack on the third day, they had <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">78</fact7> + 25 = 103 bandages.
    * Before ordering two bulk packs on the third day, they had 103 - 100 = 3 bandages.
    * This means they had 3 bandages at the end of the second day.
    * Before using 28 bandages on the second day, they had 3 + 28 = 31 bandages.
    * This means they had 31 bandages at the end of the first day.
    * Before using 38 bandages and ordering a bulk pack on the first day, they had 31 - <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">50</fact1> + <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">38</fact5> = 19 bandages.

Therefore, the nurses started with 19 bandages on the first day.  The answer is {19}.<br><br><strong>GT:</strong>19.0</div></div>

* **Month 2:** She collects 3 times the initial amount, meaning she collects 20 cards * 3 = 60 cards. However, she also collected 20 fewer cards than the first month, making it 60 cards - 20 cards = 40 cards collected in the second month. 
* **Month 3:** She collects twice the combined amount from the first two months. Combined, she had 20 cards + 40 cards = 60 cards.  Twice this amount is 60 cards * 2 = 120 cards in the third month.
* **Total:**  Over the three months, Elaine collected 20 cards + 40 cards + 120 cards = 180 cards.

</div><div class='hot_answer'><strong>182/ Reformatted Question:</strong> **

Elaine initially had <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">20 Pokemon cards</fact1>. After a month, she collected <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">three times</fact2> that number. In the third month, she collected <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">twice</fact3> the combined number of pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. In the second month, she collected <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month</fact4>. How many pokemon cards does she have now in total?


**<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>**Reformatted Question:Answer:
 <br><br>**

1. **First month's collection:** Elaine collected <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">three times</fact2> her initial number of cards, which was <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">20</fact1>. So, she collected 3 * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">20</fact1> = 60 cards in the first month.

2. **Second month's collection:** Elaine collected <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">20 fewer cards</fact4> than the first month, which means she collected 60 - <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">20</fact4> = 40 cards.  It seems there is contradictory information in the prompt. The second month should have a different amount than the first, but it says she collected three times her initial 20 AND 20 fewer than the first month's amount.  We'll consider this amount as 40 for step 3 based on the 2nd month facts and not the "three times" part of the question, to reflect the contradictory information.

3. **Third month's collection:** Elaine collected <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">twice</fact3> the combined number of cards from the first and second months.  This is 2 * (60 + 40) = 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

4. **Total cards:** To find the total number of cards, we add the initial number of cards plus the collections from each month:  <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">20</fact1> (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

Therefore, Elaine now has a total of 320 Pokemon cards.<br><br><strong>GT:</strong>320.0</div></div>

He isn't sure how long he needs to wait, but he knows that the fourth train scheduled to arrive at the station is the one he needs to get on. The first train is scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes, and this train will stay in the station for 20 minutes. The second train is to arrive half an hour after the first train leaves the station, and this second train will stay in the station for a quarter of the amount of time that the first train stayed in the station.  The fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves, and this is the train Paul will board. The third train is to arrive an hour after the second train leaves the station, and this third train is to leave the station immediately after it arrives.  In total, how long, in minutes, will Paul wait for his train?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Explanation:
First find the total time the first train is at the station: 10 minutes (arrival) + 20 minutes (stay) = 30 minutes
Then find how long the second train is at the station: 20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes
Then determine when the second train arrives: 30 minutes (first train) + 30 minutes (half hour) = 60 minutes
Then determine when the second train leaves: 60 minutes (second train arrival) + 5 minutes (second train stay) = 65 minutes
Then determine when the third train arrives: 65 minutes (second train leaves) + 60 minutes (one hour) = 125 minutes
Then determine when the fourth train arrives: 125 minutes (third train arrival) + 20 minutes = 145 minutes
Then subtract the time the first train arrived from when the fourth train arrives to find Paul's total wait time: 145 minutes - 10 minutes = 135 minutes.

In total, how long, in minutes, will Paul wait for his train?


                    Answer:
The first train arrives in <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">10 minutes</fact3> and stays for <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">20 minutes</fact4>, so it leaves after 10 + 20 = 30 minutes. The second train arrives <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">half an hour</fact6> (30 minutes) after the first train leaves, meaning it arrives 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after Paul starts waiting. The second train stays for a <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">quarter</fact7> of the time the first train stayed, which is <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">20</fact4>/4 = 5 minutes.  So, the second train leaves 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after Paul starts waiting. The third train arrives <fact10 style="background-color: #FF335E;">an hour</fact10> (60 minutes) after the second train leaves, meaning it arrives 65 + 60 = 125 minutes after Paul starts waiting. The third train leaves <fact11 style="background-color: #3378FF;">immediately</fact11>. The fourth train arrives <fact8 style="background-color: #8D33FF;">20 minutes</fact8> after the third train leaves, meaning it arrives 125 + 20 = 145 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

How much money does Sally have left?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Explanation: The taffy costs 2 / 1.5 = 1.33 sets of 1.5 pounds. Since she can only buy the taffy in sets of 1.5 pounds, we round 1.33 up to 2. This means she bought 2 sets of taffy * 1.5 pounds per set = 3 pounds of taffy. Since taffy costs $3 per pound, she spent 3 * $3 = $9 on taffy. The 4 magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1. So, in total, she spent $9 + $1.50 + $1 = $11.50. Thus, she has $10 - $11.50 = -$1.50 left.

**<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>**Reformatted Question:Answer:
 <br><br>**

Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy. The first pound cost <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$3</fact1>. The second pound was half-off, so it cost <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$3</fact1> / 2 = $1.50.  The total cost of the taffy was <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$3</fact1> + $1.50 = $4.50.

The <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">4</fact4> magnets cost <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">4</fact4> * <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$0.25</fact5> = $1.00

Her total spending was $4.50 (taffy) + <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$1.50</fact3> (seashells) + $1.00 (magnets) = $7.00

Sally started with <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">$10</fact6> and spent $7.00, so she has <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">$10</fact6> - $7.00 = $3.00 left.

Answer:
The cost of the ice cream is <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">2 tubs</fact4> * <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$7/tub</fact5> = $14.
A dozen contains 12 items, so they bought <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">12 balloons</fact2>. Since every 2 balloons cost <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$0.5</fact3>, they spent 12/2 * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$0.5</fact3> = $3 on balloons.

Since they both received the same allowance and combined it, each girl contributed $28 / <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">2</fact6> = $14.
Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.
