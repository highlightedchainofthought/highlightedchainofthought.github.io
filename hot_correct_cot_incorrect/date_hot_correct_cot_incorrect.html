Answer:

 <br><br>The question states that today is <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">9/7</fact1>, presumably referring to September 7th. The fact that Jane is watching <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">NFL 2003</fact2> implies the year is 2003.  Therefore, today's date is 09/07/2003. The answer is {09/07/2003}.<br><br><strong>GT:</strong>09/07/2003</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='cot_answer'><strong>267/ Question:</strong> Today is 9/7. Jane is watching NFL 2003. What is the date yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Today is 9/7, presumably of an unspecified year.  Jane is watching NFL 2003, but that doesn't tell us what specific date in 2003 she's watching.  The NFL season typically runs from late summer/early fall to winter, so her watching a game from 2003 doesn't pinpoint the current date. Therefore, if today is 9/7 and we're asked about yesterday, the date is 9/6. Since the year is unspecified in relation to "today", we can't determine the year for "yesterday" either.  We're told the current date is September 7th, so yesterday was September 6th.

Answer: {09/06}
