    <div class='container'><div class='cot_answer'><strong>331/ Question:</strong> Henry was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 9 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 29 trays from one table and 52 trays from another, how many trips will he make?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Explanation:
Henry needs to make trips for the first table and trips for the second table.
For the first table:
He needs to pick up 29 trays. Since he can carry only 9 trays at a time, he'll need to make 29 / 9 = 3.22... trips. Since he can't make a fraction of a trip, he'll need to make 4 trips.
For the second table:
He needs to pick up 52 trays. He'll need to make 52 / 9 = 5.77... trips. Again, he can't make a fraction of a trip, so he'll make 6 trips.

In total, Henry will make 4 + 6 = 10 trips.

Answer: {10}
