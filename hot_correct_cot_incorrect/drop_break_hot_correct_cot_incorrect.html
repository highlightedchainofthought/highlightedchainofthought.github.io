In the first quarter, the Bears struck first with kicker Robbie Gould nailing a 36-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Lions took the lead with QB Jon Kitna completing a 23-yard TD pass to TE Dan Campbell.  In the second quarter, Chicago bounced back with QB Rex Grossman completing a 13-yard TD pass to WR Bernard Berrian.  Afterwards, RB Adrian Peterson got a 2-yard TD run.  In the third quarter, Detroit retook the lead with Kitna completing a 20-yard TD pass to WR Mike Furrey and a 2-yard TD pass to WR Roy Williams.  However, in the fourth quarter, the inconsistency that continues to plague the Lions showed as the Bears won with Gould getting a 36-yard field goal, a 39-yard field goal, and a 44-yard field goal and on a dropped pass by Mike Williams in the endzone on the last play of the game.  With their seventh-straight loss, the Lions fell to 2-13 as they were swept by their division rivals. How many field goals were over 30 yards?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Here's how to solve this:

1. **Identify the field goals:** The passage mentions four field goals made by Robbie Gould.  Three of these are specified with their distances: 36 yards, 39 yards, and 44 yards.

2. **Count the field goals over 30 yards:** All three of the specified field goals are longer than 30 yards.  One field goal has an unspecified distance but we already have three field goals over 30 yards, so this one can be ignored.

Answer: {3}

<div class='container'><div class='cot_answer'><strong>16/ Question:</strong> The first issue in 1942 consisted of denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 50 centavos and 1, 5, and 10 Pesos. The next year brought "replacement notes" of the 1, 5 and 10 Pesos while 1944 ushered in a 100 Peso note and soon after an inflationary 500 Pesos note. In 1945, the Japanese issued a 1,000 Pesos note. This set of new money, which was printed even before the war, became known in the Philippines as Mickey Mouse money due to its very low value caused by severe inflation.

How many pesos was the Mickey Mouse money created by the Japanese worth?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>The passage lists the denominations of Mickey Mouse money created by the Japanese: 1, 5, 10, 50 centavos, and 1, 5, 10, 100, 500, and 1000 Pesos.  The question asks for the total worth, not the individual denominations or how many different bills there were.  Since each denomination represents a different value of money printed, we simply add them all up. 1 + 5 + 10 + 50 centavos + 1 + 5 + 10 + 100 + 500 + 1000 = 1681.5 Pesos. Centavos represent fractions of a peso, so 50 centavos is 0.5 pesos.

1. **Find the number of English people:** 21.3% of the total population (24,621) were of English descent.  So, 0.213 * 24621 = 5244.473, which we can round down to 5244 people.

2. **Find the number of Germans:** 16.5% of the total population were of German descent. So, 0.165 * 24621 = 4062.465, which we can round down to 4062 people.

3. **Find the difference:** Subtract the number of Germans from the number of English people: 5244 - 4062 = 1182

Answer: 
 <br><br>The question asks for the percentage of residents who were *not* between the ages of 18 and 24.  We are given the following percentages:

* <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Under 18: 10.1%</fact1>
* <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">18-24: 56.2%</fact2>
* <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">25-44: 16.1%</fact3>
* <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">45-64: 10.5%</fact4>
* <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">65+: 7%</fact5>

To find the percentage *not* between 18 and 24, we can add the percentages of all other age groups: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">10.1%</fact1> + <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">16.1%</fact3> + <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">10.5%</fact4> + <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">7%</fact5> = 43.7%.  Alternatively, since all percentages must add up to 100%, we can subtract the percentage between 18 and 24 from 100%: 100% - <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">56.2%</fact2> = 43.8%.  There is a slight rounding error in the given percentages. Using the given numbers for other age groups, the answer is {43.7}.<br><br><strong>GT:</strong>[43.7, 44.8]</div></div>

<div class='container'><div class='cot_answer'><strong>300/ Question:</strong> In January 1918, Romanian forces established control over Bessarabia as the Russian Army abandoned the province. Although a treaty was signed by the Romanian and Bolshevik Russian governments following talks between 5 and 9 March 1918 on the withdrawal of Romanian forces from Bessarabia within two months, on 27 March 1918 Romania formally attached Bessarabia to its territory, based on a resolution passed by the local assembly of that territory on its unification with Romania. Romania officially made peace with the Central Powers by signing the Treaty of Bucharest on 7 May 1918. Under the treaty, Romania was obliged to end the war with the Central Powers and make small territorial concessions to Austria-Hungary, ceding control of some passes in the Carpathian Mountains, and to grant oil concessions to Germany. In exchange, the Central Powers recognised the sovereignty of Romania over Bessarabia. The treaty was renounced in October 1918 by the Alexandru Marghiloman government, and Romania nominally re-entered the war on 10 November 1918. The next day, the Treaty of Bucharest was nullified by the terms of the Armistice of Compiègne.

<div class='container'><div class='cot_answer'><strong>380/ Question:</strong> Polin succeeded ambassador Antoine de Rincon  in Constantinople. In early 1542, Polin successfully negotiated the details of a Franco-Ottoman alliance for the Italian War of 1542-1546, with the Ottoman Empire promising to send 27,500 troops against the territories of the Spanish king Ferdinand, as well as 110 galleys against Charles, while France promised to attack Flanders, harass the coasts of Spain with a naval force, and send 40 galleys to assist the Turks for operations in the Levant. Polin tried to convince Venice to join the alliance, but in vain. The execution of the alliance would most notably lead to the Franco-Ottoman Siege of Nice in 1543.

How many years would pass between Polin becoming the ambassador in Constantinople before the Siege of Nice?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Polin negotiated the Franco-Ottoman alliance in early 1542. The Siege of Nice took place in August 1543.  Therefore, a little over one year passed between these two events. The question asks about the time between Polin becoming ambassador and the Siege of Nice.  Since the passage states he negotiated the alliance in early 1542, we can infer he became ambassador sometime before that.  However, we don't have a precise date for when he replaced Antoine de Rincon.  The passage says Polin succeeded Rincon, then immediately discusses the alliance negotiated in early 1542. Therefore, a little over one year is a reasonable estimate.

<div class='container'><div class='cot_answer'><strong>425/ Question:</strong> One week later, Dallas faced the 1993 San Francisco 49ers season in the NFC Championship Game for the second year in a row in what was, at the time, the last NFL game to air on CBS.  The 49ers had the NFLs highest scoring offense with 473 points, 97 more than the runner-up Cowboys.  The last time the two teams played for the NFC title, Dallas won when Aikman thwarted an attempted 49ers comeback with a touchdown drive late in the fourth quarter.  But this time, the game was extremely one-sided.  The Cowboys scored touchdowns on four of their five first-half possessions.  By the end of the half, Dallas had a commanding 28-7 lead.  Aikman completed 14 of 18 passes for 177 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions, while also rushing for 25 yards, but was knocked out of the game with a concussion in the third quarter.  Then San Francisco scored a touchdown, making the score 28-14 with plenty of time left for a comeback.  However, their hopes were soon dashed as backup quarterback Bernie Kosar, who had already played in three conference championship games and was unable to advance to the Super Bowl each time, led the Cowboys 82 yards to go up 35-14 on his 42-yard touchdown pass to Alvin Harper.  Murray then put the finishing touches on San Francisco with a 50-yard field goal, while all the 49ers could do was score a useless touchdown in "garbage time" to make the final score 38-21.

How many passes did Aikman not complete in the first half?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Here's how to find the answer:

1. **Find Aikman's total passes in the first half:** The passage states Aikman completed 14 of 18 passes *in the entire game*. It doesn't specify how many were in the first half.

2. **Determine incomplete passes:** Since we only know his total passes and completions for the *whole game*, we can only calculate his incomplete passes for the *whole game*.  He threw 18 passes and completed 14, meaning he had 18 - 14 = 4 incomplete passes in the whole game.

3. **Insufficient information:** The passage *doesn't provide enough information* to determine how many passes Aikman didn't complete in the *first half* specifically.

<div class='container'><div class='cot_answer'><strong>435/ Question:</strong> The Guatemalan authorities were unaware of ongoing contacts between the colonial authorities in Yucatán and the Itza. In the second half of 1695 President Barrios began planning another expedition against the Itza from Verapaz, following harsh criticism of Juan Díaz de Velasco's retreat from near Lake Petén Itzá in April of that year. Barrios died in November, and oidor José de Escals became acting head of the Guatemalan colonial administration. He appointed oidor Bartolomé de Amésqueta to lead the next expedition against the Itza. Amésqueta marched his men through torrential rain from Cahabón to Mopán, arriving on 25 February 1696; the Guatemalans were still unaware of the clashes between García's forces and the Itza. Amésqueta's expedition was suffering from shortages of native labour and supplies. Twenty-five of his 150 men were sick, and his advance stalled as the force rested up at Mopán. Captain Díaz de Velasco volunteered to lead a party of 25 men ahead to the lake; he was accompanied by Dominican friars Cristóbal de Prada and Jacinto de Vargas. He was also accompanied by AjK'ixaw, the Itza nobleman who had been taken prisoner on Díaz's previous expedition, who served as a trusted guide, scout and translator. They set out from Mopán on 7 March and left some sick soldiers with some supplies after five days, they then caught up with an advance party of roadbuilders and their military escort at Río Chakal. The two forces combined, giving Díaz a force of 49 soldiers and 34 porters and archers from Verapaz. Once they arrived at IxB'ol, near the shore of Lake Petén Itzá, AjK'ixaw was sent ahead as an emissary to Nojpetén. How many months after harsh criticism of Juan Diaz de Velasco's retreat from near Lake Petén Itzá did Barrios die?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Here's how to find the solution:

1. **Identify the key events:** Juan Díaz de Velasco's retreat was in April 1695. President Barrios began planning another expedition after this retreat, in the second half of 1695. Barrios died in November 1695.

2. **Determine the timeframe:** The question asks for the number of months between the criticism of the retreat (which prompted the planning of the next expedition) and Barrios' death.  The passage states the planning began in the second half of 1695, meaning after June. We can assume the criticism and subsequent planning occurred shortly after the retreat in April. Barrios then died in November.

3. **Calculate the difference:** From roughly April/May to November, there are approximately 6-7 months. Since the question asks "how many months *after* the criticism," and the criticism happened in the second half of the year after the April retreat, the death in November would fall within that timeframe.

In the second half of 1695 <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">President Barrios began planning another expedition against the Itza</fact1> from Verapaz, following <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">harsh criticism of Juan Díaz de Velasco's retreat from near Lake Petén Itzá in April of that year</fact2>. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Barrios died in November</fact3>, and oidor José de Escals became acting head of the Guatemalan colonial administration. He appointed oidor Bartolomé de Amésqueta to lead the next expedition against the Itza. Amésqueta marched his men through torrential rain from Cahabón to Mopán, arriving on 25 February 1696; the Guatemalans were still unaware of the clashes between García's forces and the Itza. Amésqueta's expedition was suffering from shortages of native labour and supplies. Twenty-five of his 150 men were sick, and his advance stalled as the force rested up at Mopán. Captain Díaz de Velasco volunteered to lead a party of 25 men ahead to the lake; he was accompanied by Dominican friars Cristóbal de Prada and Jacinto de Vargas. He was also accompanied by AjK'ixaw, the Itza nobleman who had been taken prisoner on Díaz's previous expedition, who served as a trusted guide, scout and translator. They set out from Mopán on 7 March and left some sick soldiers with some supplies after five days, they then caught up with an advance party of roadbuilders and their military escort at Río Chakal. The two forces combined, giving Díaz a force of 49 soldiers and 34 porters and archers from Verapaz. Once they arrived at IxB'ol, near the shore of Lake Petén Itzá, AjK'ixaw was sent ahead as an emissary to Nojpetén. How many months after harsh criticism of Juan Diaz de Velasco's retreat from near Lake Petén Itzá did Barrios die?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Reformatted Question: 

Answer: 
 <br><br>According to the passage, the criticism of Juan Díaz de Velasco's retreat (<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">) occurred in April of 1695, and Barrios died (<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">) in November of 1695.

<div class='container'><div class='cot_answer'><strong>466/ Question:</strong> From November 1943, during the seven-week Battle of Changde, the Chinese forced Japan to fight a costly war of attrition, while awaiting Allied relief. In January 1944, the Allies launched a series of attacks in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino and tried to outflank it with landings at Anzio. By the end of January, a major Soviet offensive expelled German forces from the Leningrad region, ending the longest and most lethal siege in history. The following Soviet offensive was halted on the pre-war Estonian border by the German Army Group North aided by Estonians hoping to re-establish national independence. This delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in the Baltic Sea region. By late May 1944, the Soviets had liberated Crimea, largely expelled Axis forces from Ukraine, and made incursions into Romania, which were repulsed by the Axis troops. The Allied offensives in Italy had succeeded and, at the expense of allowing several German divisions to retreat, on 4 June, Rome was captured. The Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia. In March 1944, the Japanese launched the first of two invasions, an operation against British positions in Assam, India, and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at Imphal and Kohima. In May 1944, British forces mounted a counter-offensive that drove Japanese troops back to Burma, and Chinese forces that had invaded northern Burma in late 1943 besieged Japanese troops in Myitkyina. The second Japanese invasion of China aimed to destroy China's main fighting forces, secure railways between Japanese-held territory and capture Allied airfields.

1. **Find the original pension for a single person:** The passage states the pension for a single person *after* the raise is 1,700 francs, and the raise was 300 francs.  So, the original pension was 1,700 - 300 = 1,400 francs.

2. **Find the original pension for a couple:** The passage states the pension for a couple *after* the raise is 3,700 francs, and the raise was 300 francs *per person* meaning 600 francs total for a couple.  So, the original pension for a couple was 3,700 - 600 = 3,100 francs.

3. **Calculate the combined total:**  The combined original pension for a single person and a couple is 1,400 + 3,100 = 4,500 francs.

How many areas used napalm in only one year?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Here's how we find the answer:

The question asks how many areas used napalm in *only* one year. We need to look for years that are mentioned only once in connection with a specific area's use of napalm.

* **1967:** Six-Day War by Israel
* **1969:** Nigeria
* **1982:** Argentina

These three years are each mentioned only once.  Therefore, three areas used napalm in only one year.

Answer: {3}

How many areas used napalm in only one year?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Reformatted Question: 
Answer: 
 <br><br>The question asks how many areas used napalm in only one year.  Looking at the years provided:

* <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Israel in 1967</fact4>
* <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Nigeria in 1969</fact5>
* <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">Egypt in 1973</fact7>
* <fact9 style="background-color: #33FF8D;">Argentina in 1982</fact9>

India and Pakistan used napalm in two separate years listed (<fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">1965 and 1971</fact6>), so they are not counted. Iraq also used it in multiple years (<fact11 style="background-color: #3378FF;">1980-1988 and 1991</fact11>).  All the other instances span multiple years (<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">1946-1954</fact1>, <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1954-1962</fact2>, <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">1961-1974</fact3>, <fact8 style="background-color: #8D33FF;">1975-1991</fact8>, <fact10 style="background-color: #FF335E;">1980-1988</fact10>, <fact12 style="background-color: #FFB833;">1991-1996</fact12>). Therefore, only four areas used napalm in a single listed year.  So the answer is {4}.<br><br><strong>GT:</strong>[4.0, 6.0]</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='cot_answer'><strong>691/ Question:</strong> In 1918, party membership was approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in an intensive recruitment campaign, the "Lenin Levy", resulting in new members referred to as the Lenin Enrolment, from both the working class and rural areas. This represented an attempt to "proletarianize" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the Old Bolsheviks and reducing their influence in the Party. In 1925, the party had 1,025,000 members in a Soviet population of 147 million. In 1927, membership had risen to 1,200,000. During the collectivization campaign and industrialization campaigns of the first five-year plan from 1929 to 1933, party membership grew rapidly to approximately 3.5 million members. However, party leaders suspected that the mass intake of new members had allowed "social-alien elements" to penetrate the partys ranks and document verifications of membership ensued in 1933 and 1935, removing supposedly unreliable members. Meanwhile, the party closed its ranks to new members from 1933 to November 1936. Even after the reopening of party recruiting, membership fell to 1.9 million by 1939. Nicholas DeWitt gives 2.307 million members in 1939, including candidate members, compared with 1.535 million in 1929 and 6.3 million in 1947. In 1986, the CPSU had over 19 million membersapproximately 10% of the Soviet Unions adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers and 12% as collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in 14 of the Soviet Unions 15 republics. The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic itself had no separate Communist Party until 1990 because the CPSU controlled affairs there directly. How many members did the party lose 1933 to 1939?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Here's how to solve this:

1. **Find the starting membership:** The passage states party membership was approximately 3.5 million in 1933.

2. **Find the ending membership:** The passage states membership fell to 1.9 million by 1939.

3. **Calculate the difference:** 3.5 million - 1.9 million = 1.6 million

Answer: {1.6 million}
